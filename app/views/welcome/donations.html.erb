<p>Let me introduce myself. Hi! I'm M.Jean.Felix a Haitian-American writer and artist from Boston. I'm an Edie Winsdor Scholar thro Lesbian Who Tech and this is my first fully running site. Its not perfect but its a great start for someone who had only known Ruby for a few short days.</p>
<p>I'm currently attending the General assembly WDI Immersive boot camp, which is incredibly challenging.</p>

<p>I have written a novel called 'Seven Days in Port-au-Prince about my family's experience during the earthquake that devasted Haiti in 2010, an exceprt of which appears in the Lambda literary Foundation anthology Emerge. You can purchase a copy of it at this link.

<p>After the earthquake that struck Haiti in 2010 I was asked to join the 2nd Ghetto Biennale: A Salon de Refuse, where I performed a piece that was a meditation on the Haitian Diaspora. I gathered items from the debris around Port-au-Prince and created a human figure, which I carried on my back walking the full distance from where my mother was from, Jacmel, to where my father is from Port-au-Prince. It is a distance of 72 kilometers hiking through the mountains. Here is a link to that project.

<p>I received an M.F.A. in Creative Writing and the novel 'Seven Days in Port-au-Prince was my thesis project. Here is a link to my thesis reading</p>
