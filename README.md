#Next Steps

Unsolved problems: <br>
I still have to find a way to truncate the longers submissions so they with not over shadow the other works . I to poets were a bit easy but the ficton writers sent me long subs. 

I am using inline styling :{

}

         div#blackemerald {
        width: 60em;
        text-align: center;
        white-space: nowrap;
        overflow: hidden;
        text-overflow: ellipsis;
      } 
I am using it in the <style> tag of the 'writer.communiy.html.erb. I stil l an working on it cuz the noverlist is ridiculously talented and a I want to make sure I what her 3 page novel Excerpt correctly. I was thinking if to a linking page but not there yet.



#Final Thought:
We al are on our way, at our ouw pace and if we workd hard and help each other as a good we can not only fail better, but not fail at all.

In  writing community we go through pages of pages of work that seem great one day by then after a sober re-assemnent needed a ton of work.  So the curationing process will be very challenging

I am still working on the entering infor into thr database.
